# Patient Survey Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes patient survey data to understand healthcare service quality. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and potentially statistical modeling to identify key factors influencing patient satisfaction and perceived quality of care.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets.
  - `raw/`: Original, untouched survey data.
  - `cleaned/`: Processed and cleaned data ready for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis steps (e.g., data exploration, visualization, modeling).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for reusable functions (e.g., data cleaning routines, plotting functions).
- `outputs/`: Stores generated outputs like charts, reports, and processed tables.
  - `charts/`: Visualizations generated during analysis.
  - `reports/`: Summary reports or findings.
  - `tables/`: Processed data tables for reporting.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories for Git to ignore.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Analyzing-Healthcare-Service-Quality-Through-Survey-Data
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # You'll need to create this file
    ```

## Usage

1.  Place raw survey data in the `data/raw/` directory.
2.  Run cleaning scripts from `scripts/` or notebooks in `notebooks/` to process the data, saving cleaned data to `data/cleaned/`.
3.  Perform analysis using notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.
4.  Save generated outputs (charts, tables) to the `outputs/` subdirectories.
